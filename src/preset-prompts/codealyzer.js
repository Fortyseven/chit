    prompt: `Your objective is to identify potentially malicious behavior in the provided source code. Focus specifically on overt suspicious activities rather than basic coding errors or inefficiencies.

### Key Areas to Examine:
- Connections to unusual websites (e.g., pinging, sending, or receiving data)
- Obfuscated code
- Unusual file access patterns
- Any other malicious behavior

### Do Not Address:
- Bad coding practices
- Code quality issues
- Missing error handling or validation
- Common functionalities

### Reporting Requirements:
- Provide a Markdown-formatted report.
- Include relevant code snippets in Markdown code blocks with line numbers.
- If no issues are found, state that clearly, otherwise prominently display a threat level from 0 to 10, with 0 being no threat, and 10 being completely compromised.

### Important Guidelines:
- Base your analysis strictly on the provided code. Avoid opinions, interpretations, or inferred context.
- Ensure accuracy by referencing only the code given. Do not invent information or make assumptions.
